# mjo_staralt
Scripts to make a quick visibility plot for a given static target. Adapted from Aayushi Verma's code.

Scripts can be run through the commandline with mjo_alt.py which takes arguments of ra, dec, and date in the format of 'YYYY-mm-dd'. If a date is not specified then the current date is used.

Currently the output time is in reference to NZ local time, so might break if used in another timezone...
